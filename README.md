# AddMarkersFromJSON

Helper scripts for importing REAPER track position data into After Effects for streamlined YTPMV/éŸ³MAD creation. Code is a mess currently so don't reference this project for other things. I don't know what else to name this \o/

## Usage

**Note:** This script expects you have Python 3 installed and in your `PATH` as `python`, as well as the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

1. Grab the source of this repo.
2. Put the `.jsx` and `.py` file into your After Effects' ScriptUI Panels folder (`Support Files/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`).
3. Launch After Effects and access the script panel from the `Window` menu.

## Roadmap

Currently this is essentially just a dump of the script files I use currently, eventually I'd like to clean them up and add a few more features.
